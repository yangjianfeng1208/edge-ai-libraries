# Build from Source

Build the Visual Pipeline and Platform Evaluation Tool from the source to customize, debug, or extend its
functionality. In this guide, you will:

- Set up your development environment.
- Compile the source code and resolve dependencies.
- Generate a runnable build for local testing or deployment.

This guide is ideal for developers who want to work directly with the source code.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following:

- **System Requirements**: Verify your system meets the [minimum requirements](./system-requirements.md).
- **Dependencies Installed**:
  - **Git tool**: [Install Git tool](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- **Permissions**: Confirm you have permissions to install software and modify environment configurations.

This guide assumes basic familiarity with Git commands, Python virtual environments, and terminal usage. If you are
new to these concepts, see:

- [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)

## Steps to Build

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Run:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries.git
     cd ./edge-ai-libraries/tools/visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool
     ```

2. **Build and Start the Tool**:
   - Run the following command:

     ```bash
     make build run
     ```

## Validation

1. **Verify Build Success**:
   - Check the logs. Look for confirmation messages indicating that the microservice has started successfully.
2. **Access the Microservice**:
   - Open a browser and go to:

     ```text
     http://localhost:7860/?__theme=light
     ```

   - Expected result: The microservice's UI loads successfully.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Environment Configuration Issues**:
   - Verify environment variables:

     ```bash
     echo $VARIABLE_NAME
     ```
