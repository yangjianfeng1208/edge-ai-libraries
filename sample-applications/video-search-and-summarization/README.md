# Video Search and Summarization (VSS) Sample Application

Video search and summarization is a foundational sample application that provides the following set of video analytics capabilities:

| Mode | Use To | Capability |
|---|---|---|
| Video Search | Find specific content within large video datasets. | Extract and index visual, audio, and textual features from video frames using the LangChain framework, multimodal embedding models, and agentic reasoning. Query using natural language or multi-modal models. |
| Video Summarization | Create concise summaries of long-form videos or live streams. | Improve searchability. Combine insights from different data types using Generative AI Vision Language Models (VLMs), computer vision, and audio analysis. |
| Combined Video Search and Summarization | Find specific content and create concise summaries of videos - ideal for a comprehensive video analysis. | Search directly over generated video summaries. Using the summary as a knowledge base makes the search results more relevant and accurate. |
