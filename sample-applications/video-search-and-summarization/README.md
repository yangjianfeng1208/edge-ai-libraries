# Video Search and Summarization (VSS) Sample Application

Use the Video Search and Summarization (VSS) sample application to search through your videos, summarize them, and more.

This foundational sample application provides three modes:

| Mode | Use To | Capability |
|---|---|---|
| 🔍 Video Search | Find specific content within large video datasets through natural language. | Extract and index visual, audio, and textual features from video frames using the LangChain framework, multimodal embedding models, and agentic reasoning. Query using natural language or multi-modal models. |
| 📝 Video Summarization | Create concise summaries of long-form videos or live streams, automatically. | Improve searchability. Combine insights from different data types using Generative AI Vision Language Models (VLMs), computer vision, and audio analysis. |
| 🔗 Combined Video Search and Summarization | Find specific content and create concise summaries of videos - ideal for a comprehensive video analysis. | Search quickly and directly over generated video summaries. Using the summary as a knowledge base makes the search results more relevant and accurate. |

The detailed documentation to help you get started, configure, and deploy the sample application along with the required microservices are as follows.

## Why Use VSS?

- **Data privacy**: Local processing ensures your data stays private.
- **Ease of use**: You can search using natural language.
- **Improved accuracy**: Multi-modal analysis works on video, audio, and text at the same time, which improves the results.
- **Scalability**: You can work on one or multiple videos automatically.
