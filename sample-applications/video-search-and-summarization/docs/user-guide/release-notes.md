# Release Notes

## Current Release

**Version**: 1.3.1 \
**Release Date**: 20 Nov 2025  

**Features**:

- [VLM] Added cleanup helpers so every request releases OpenVINO infer requests; streaming responses call this once the event stream finishes to release resource and merge back the threads.
- Sanity on user_override_variables.yaml file in VSS helm chart.
- Updated the VLM, MME, VDMS-Dataprep docs to enable user to download public docker image and
- added notes on embedding model selection for Helm charts.
- Exposed the env variable `MAX_CONTEXT_LENGTH` to enable user to override this value for setting LLM model context length.
- Trivy scan fixes for  audio-analyzer-microservice,  multimodal-embedding-microservice, pipeline-manager, vdms-dataprep, video-ingestion, video-search, vlm-openvino-serving.
- Sanity on some deprecated field in helm which previously treat as Warning but now it have been treated as ERROR in latest helm version.
- Removed failed search queries from search left column.
- Fixed search UI checkbox selection/deselection issue.
- Fixed VSS video upload streamable mp4 error message.
- Documentations updates and some other required setup-script/code fixes to be able to build standalone Audio-Analyzer image and run/use it without any external dependency (like minio etc).
- Updated image tags for various components and helm chart to version 1.3.1.

**HW used for validation**:

- Intel® Xeon® 5 + Intel® Arc&trade; B580 GPU
- Vanilla Kubernetes Cluster

**Known Issues/Limitations**:

- EMF and EMT are not supported yet.
- Video Summarization with `mini_cpm` model not working on Xeon® 4 and Xeon® 6 machines.
- Occasionally, the VLM/OVMS models may generate repetitive responses in a loop. We are actively working to resolve this issue in an upcoming update.
- HW sizing of the Video Search or Video Summarization pipeline is in progress. Optimization of the pipelines will follow HW sizing.
- VLM models on GPUs currently support only `microsoft/Phi-3.5-vision-instruct`.
- Known issues are internally tracked. Reference not provided here.
- `how-to-performance` document is not updated yet. HW sizing details will be added to this section shortly.
- Sometimes during search, the response is not instantaneous. However, users can use the refresh button to fetch the results.
- Directory Watcher service only supported in Search only mode.
