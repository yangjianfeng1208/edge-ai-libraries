## ⚙️ Setting Required Environment Variables

<a name="required-env"></a>

Before running the application, you need to set several environment variables:

1. **Registry Configuration**:
   The application uses registry URL and tag to pull the required images.

    ```bash
    export REGISTRY_URL=intel   
    export TAG=1.2.2
    ```

2. **Required credentials for some services**:
   Following variables **MUST** be set on your current shell before running the setup script:

    ```bash
    # MinIO credentials (object storage)
    export MINIO_ROOT_USER=<your-minio-username>
    export MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=<your-minio-password>

    # PostgreSQL credentials (database)
    export POSTGRES_USER=<your-postgres-username>
    export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<your-postgres-password>

    # RabbitMQ credentials (message broker)
    export RABBITMQ_USER=<your-rabbitmq-username>
    export RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=<your-rabbitmq-password>
    ```

3. **Setting environment variables for customizing model selection**:

    These environment variables **MUST** be set on your current shell. Setting these variables help you customize which models are used for deployment.

    ```bash
    # For VLM-based chunk captioning and video summary on CPU
    export VLM_MODEL_NAME="Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct"  # or any other supported VLM model on CPU

    # For VLM-based chunk captioning and video summary on GPU
    export VLM_MODEL_NAME="microsoft/Phi-3.5-vision-instruct"  # or any other supported VLM model on GPU

    # (Optional) For OVMS-based video summary (when using with ENABLE_OVMS_LLM_SUMMARY=true or ENABLE_OVMS_LLM_SUMMARY_GPU=true)
    export OVMS_LLM_MODEL_NAME="Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3"  # or any other supported LLM model

    # Model used by Audio Analyzer service. Only Whisper models variants are supported.
    # Common Supported models: tiny.en, small.en, medium.en, base.en, large-v1, large-v2, large-v3.
    # You can provide just one or comma-separated list of models.
    export ENABLED_WHISPER_MODELS="tiny.en,small.en,medium.en"

    # Object detection model used for Video Ingestion Service. Only Yolo models are supported.
    export OD_MODEL_NAME="yolov8l-worldv2"

    # SETTING EMBEDDING MODELS
    # Set this when using --search option to run the application in video search mode. This enables a multimodal embedding model capable of generating correlated text and image embeddings. Only openai/clip-vit-base model is supported as of now.
    export VCLIP_MODEL=openai/clip-vit-base-patch32

    # Set this when using --all option to run application in combined summarization and search mode. Only Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B is supported as of now.
    export QWEN_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B
    ```

5. **Directory Watcher Configuration (Video Search Mode Only)**:

    For automated video ingestion in search mode, you can use the directory watcher service:

    ```bash
    # Path to the directory to watch on the host system. Default: "edge-ai-libraries/sample-applications/video-search-and-summarization/data"
    export VS_WATCHER_DIR="/path/to/your/video/directory"
    ```

    > **📁 Directory Watcher**: For complete setup instructions, configuration options, and usage details, see the [Directory Watcher Service Guide](./directory-watcher-guide.md). This service only works with `--search` mode.

6. **Advanced VLM Configuration Options**:

    The following environment variables provide additional control over VLM inference behavior and logging:

    ```bash
    # (Optional) OpenVINO Configuration for VLM inference optimization
    # Pass OpenVINO configuration parameters as a JSON string to fine-tune inference performance
    # Default latency-optimized configuration (equivalent to not setting OV_CONFIG)
    # export OV_CONFIG='{"PERFORMANCE_HINT": "LATENCY"}'

    # Throughput-optimized configuration
    export OV_CONFIG='{"PERFORMANCE_HINT": "THROUGHPUT"}'
    ```

    > **_IMPORTANT:_** The `OV_CONFIG` variable is used to pass OpenVINO configuration parameters to the VLM service. It allows you to optimize inference performance based on your hardware and workload.
    > For a complete list of OpenVINO configuration options, refer to the [OpenVINO Documentation](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/openvino-workflow/running-inference/inference-devices-and-modes.html).
    > **Note**: If OV_CONFIG is not set, the default configuration `{"PERFORMANCE_HINT": "LATENCY"}` will be used.

**🔐 Working with Gated Models**

   To run a **GATED MODEL** like Llama models, the user will need to pass their [huggingface token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens#user-access-tokens). The user will need to request access to specific model by going to the respective model page on HuggingFace.

   Go to <https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens> to get your token.

   ```bash
   export GATED_MODEL=true
   export HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=<your_huggingface_token>
   ```

Once exported, run the setup script as mentioned [here](#running-the-application). Please switch off the `GATED_MODEL` flag by running `export GATED_MODEL=false`, once you are no more using gated models. This avoids unnecessary authentication step during setup.

## 📊 Application Stacks Overview

The Video Summary application offers multiple stacks and deployment options:

| Stack | Description | Flag (used with setup script) |
|-------|-------------|------|
| Video Summary | Video frame captioning and Summary | `--summary` |
| Video Search | Video indexing and semantic search | `--search` |
| Video Search + Summary | Both summary and search capabilities | `--all` |

> **📁 Automated Video Ingestion**: The Video Search stack includes an optional Directory Watcher service for automated video processing. See the [Directory Watcher Service Guide](./directory-watcher-guide.md) for details on setting up automatic video monitoring and ingestion.

### 🧩 Deployment Options for Video Summary

## ▶️ Running the Application

<a name="running-app"></a>

> **ℹ️ Note for EMT (Edge Microvisor Toolkit) Users**
>
> If you are running the VSS application on an OS image built with **Edge Microvisor Toolkit (EMT)**—an Azure Linux-based build pipeline for Intel® platforms—you must install the following package:
>
> ```bash
> sudo dnf install mesa-libGL
> # If you are using TDNF, you can use the following command to install:
> sudo tdnf search mesa-libGL
> sudo tdnf install mesa-libGL
> ```
>
> Installing `mesa-libGL` provides the OpenGL library which is needed by `Audio Analyzer service`.

Follow these steps to run the application:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries.git
    cd edge-ai-libraries/sample-applications/video-search-and-summarization
    ```

2. Set the required environment variables as described [here](#required-env).

3. Run the setup script with the appropriate flag, depending on your use case.

   > NOTE: Before switching to a different mode always stop the current application stack by running:

   ```bash
   source setup.sh --down
   ```

   > **💡 Clean Up Tip**: If you encounter issues or want to completely reset the application data, use `source setup.sh --clean-data` to stop all containers and remove all Docker volumes including user data. This provides a fresh start for troubleshooting.

- **To run Video Summary only:**

    ```bash
    source setup.sh --summary
    ```

- **To run Video Search only:**

    ```bash
    source setup.sh --search
    ```

    > **📁 Directory Watcher**: For automated video ingestion and processing in search mode, see the [Directory Watcher Service Guide](./directory-watcher-guide.md) to learn how to set up automatic monitoring and processing of video files from a specified directory.

- **To run Unified Video Search and Summary :**

    ```bash
    source setup.sh --all
    ```

- **To run Video Summary with OVMS Microservice for final summary :**

    ```bash
    ENABLE_OVMS_LLM_SUMMARY=true source setup.sh --summary
    ```

4. (Optional) Verify the resolved environment variables and setup configurations.

    ```bash
    # To just set environment variables without starting containers
    source setup.sh --setenv

    # To see resolved configurations for summary services without starting containers
    source setup.sh --summary config

    # To see resolved configurations for search services without starting containers
    source setup.sh --search config

    # To see resolved configurations for both search and summary services combined without starting containers
    source setup.sh --all config

    # To see resolved configurations for summary services with OVMS setup on CPU without starting containers
    ENABLE_OVMS_LLM_SUMMARY=true source setup.sh --summary config
    ```

### ⚡ Using GPU Acceleration

To use GPU acceleration for VLM inference:

   > NOTE: Before switching to a different mode always stop the current application stack by running:

   ```bash
   source setup.sh --down
   ```

```bash
ENABLE_VLM_GPU=true source setup.sh --summary
```

To use GPU acceleration for OVMS-based summary:

```bash
ENABLE_OVMS_LLM_SUMMARY_GPU=true source setup.sh --summary
```

To use GPU acceleration for vclip-embedding-ms for search usecase:

```bash
ENABLE_EMBEDDING_GPU=true source setup.sh --search
```

To verify configuration and resolved environment variables without running the application:

```bash
# For VLM inference on GPU
ENABLE_VLM_GPU=true source setup.sh --summary config
```

```bash
# For OVMS inference on GPU
ENABLE_OVMS_LLM_SUMMARY_GPU=true source setup.sh --summary config
```

```bash
# For vclip-embedding-ms on GPU
ENABLE_EMBEDDING_GPU=true source setup.sh --search config
```

> **_NOTE:_** Please avoid setting `ENABLE_VLM_GPU`, `ENABLE_OVMS_LLM_SUMMARY_GPU`, or `ENABLE_EMBEDDING_GPU` explicitly on shell using `export`, as you need to switch these flags off as well, to return back to CPU configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Containers started but Application not working

- You can try resetting the volume storage, by deleting the previously created volumes using following commands:

  ```bash
  source setup.sh --clean-data
  ```
  
  > **_NOTE :_** This step does not apply when you are setting up the application for the first time.

### VLM Microservice Model Loading Issues

**Problem**: VLM microservice fails to load or save models with permission errors, or you see errors related to model access in the logs.

**Cause**: This issue occurs when the `ov-models` Docker volume was created with incorrect ownership (root user) in previous versions of the application. The VLM microservice runs as a non-root user and requires proper permissions to read/write models.

**Symptoms**:
- VLM microservice container fails to start or crashes during model loading
- Permission denied errors in VLM service logs
- Model conversion or caching failures
- Error messages mentioning `/home/appuser/.cache/huggingface` or `/app/ov-model` access issues

**Solution**:
1. Stop the running application:
   ```bash
   source setup.sh --down
   ```

2. Remove the existing `ov-models` (old volume name) and `docker_ov-models` (updated volume name) Docker volume:
   ```bash
   docker volume rm ov-models docker_ov-models
   ```

3. Restart the application (the volume will be recreated with correct permissions):
   ```bash
   # For Video Summary
   source setup.sh --summary
   
   # Or for Video Search
   source setup.sh --search
   ```

**Note**: Removing the `ov-models`/`docker_ov-models` volume will delete any previously cached/converted models. The VLM service will automatically re-download and convert models on the next startup, which may take additional time depending on your internet connection and the model size.

**Prevention**: This issue has been fixed in the current version of the VLM microservice Dockerfile. New installations will automatically create the volume with correct permissions.

### VLM Final Summary Hallucination Issues

**Problem**: The final summary generated by the VLM microservice contains hallucinated or inaccurate information that doesn't reflect the actual video content.

**Cause**: This issue can occur when using smaller VLM models that may not have sufficient capacity to accurately process and summarize complex video content, leading to generation of plausible but incorrect information.

**Symptoms**:

- Final summary contains information not present in the video
- Summary describes events, objects, or activities that don't actually occur in the video
- Inconsistent or contradictory information in the generated summary
- Summary quality is poor despite chunk-wise summaries being accurate

**Solution**:
Try using a larger, more capable VLM model by updating the `VLM_MODEL_NAME` environment variable:

1. Stop the running application:

   ```bash
   source setup.sh --down
   ```

2. Set a larger VLM model (e.g., upgrade from 3B to 7B parameters):

   ```bash
   export VLM_MODEL_NAME="Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct"
   ```

3. Restart the application:

   ```bash
   source setup.sh --summary
   ```

**Alternative Models to Try**:

- For CPU: `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct` (larger version)
- For GPU: Consider other supported VLM models with higher parameter counts

**Note**: Larger models will require more system resources (RAM/VRAM) and may have longer inference times, but typically provide more accurate and coherent summaries.
