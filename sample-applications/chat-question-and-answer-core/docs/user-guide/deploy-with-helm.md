# How to deploy with Helm

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the Chat Question-and-Answer Core Sample Application using Helm.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
- Kubernetes cluster set up and running.
- The cluster must support **dynamic provisioning of Persistent Volumes (PV)**. Refer to the [Kubernetes Dynamic Provisioning Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/) for more details.
- Install `kubectl` on your system. Refer to [Installation Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/). Ensure access to the Kubernetes cluster.
- Install `helm` on your system. Refer to [Installation Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

## Steps to deploy with Helm

You can deploy the ChatQ&A Core application using `Helm` in **two ways**: by pulling the Helm chart from Docker Hub or by building it from the source code. Follow the steps below based on your preferred method.

**_⚠️ Note: Steps 1–3 differ depending on whether you choose to pull the chart or build it from source._**

### Option 1: Pull the Helm Chart from Docker Hub

#### Step 1: Pull the Helm Chart

Use the following command to pull the Helm chart from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/chat-question-and-answer-core):

```bash
helm pull oci://registry-1.docker.io/intel/chat-question-and-answer-core --version <version-no>
```

🔍 Refer to the [Docker Hub tags page](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/chat-question-and-answer-core/tags) for details on the latest version number to use for the sample application.


#### Step 2: Extract the Chart

Unpack the downloaded .tgz file:

```bash
tar -xvf chat-question-and-answer-core-<version-no>.tgz
cd chat-question-and-answer-core
```

#### Step 3: Configure `values.yaml`

Edit the `values.yaml` file to set the necessary environment variables. Ensure you set the `huggingface.apiToken` and `proxy settings` as required.

To enable GPU support, set the configuration parameter `gpu.enabled` to `true` and provide the corresponding `gpu.key` that assigned in your cluster node in the `values.yaml` file.

For detailed information on supported and validated hardware platforms and configurations, please refer to the [Validated Hardware Platform](./system-requirements.md) section.


| Key | Description | Example Value | Required When |
| --- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `configmap.enabled` | Enable use of ConfigMap for model configuration. Set to true to use ConfigMap; otherwise, defaults in the application are used. (true/false) | true | Always. Default to `true` in `values.yaml` |
| `global.huggingface.apiToken` | Hugging Face API token | `<your-huggingface-token>` | Always |
| `global.EMBEDDING_MODEL` | Embedding Model Name | BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 | if `configmap.enabled = true` |
| `global.RERANKER_MODEL` | Reranker model name	| BAAI/bge-reranker-base | if `configmap.enabled = true` |
| `global.LLM_MODEL	` | LLM model for OVMS | microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct | if `configmap.enabled = true` |
| `global.PROMPT_TEMPLATE` | RAG template for formatting input to the LLM. Supports {context} and {question}. Leave empty to use default. | See `values.yaml` for example | Optional |
| `global.UI_NODEPORT` | Static port for UI service (30000–32767). Leave empty for automatic assignment. |  | Optional |
| `global.keeppvc` | Persist storage (true/false) | false | Optional. Default to `false` in `values.yaml` |
| `global.EMBEDDING_DEVICE` | Device for embedding (CPU/GPU) | CPU | Always. Default to `CPU` in `values.yaml` |
| `global.RERANKER_DEVICE` | Device for reranker (CPU/GPU) | CPU | Always. Default to `CPU` in `values.yaml` |
| `global.LLM_DEVICE` | Device for LLM (CPU/GPU) | CPU | Always. Default to `CPU` in `values.yaml` |
| `gpu.enabled` | Deploy on GPU (true/false) | false | Optional |
| `gpu.key` | Label assigned to the GPU node on kubernetes cluster by the device plugin. Example - `gpu.intel.com/i915`, `gpu.intel.com/xe`. Identify by running `kubectl describe node` | `<your-node-key-on-cluster>` | If `gpu.enabled = true` |

**🔍NOTE**:

- If `configmap.enabled` is set to false, the application will use its default internal configuration. You can view the default configuration template [here](../../model_config/sample/template.yaml).

- If `gpu.enabled` is set to `false`, the parameters `global.EMBEDDING_DEVICE`, `global.RERANKER_DEVICE`, and `global.LLM_DEVICE` must not be set to `GPU`.
A validation check is included and will throw an error if any of these parameters are incorrectly set to `GPU` while `GPU support is disabled`.

- When `gpu.enabled` is set to `true`, the default value for these device parameters is GPU. On systems with an integrated GPU, the device ID is always 0 (i.e., GPU.0), and GPU is treated as an alias for GPU.0.
For systems with multiple GPUs (e.g., both integrated and discrete Intel GPUs), you can specify the desired devices using comma-separated IDs such as GPU.0, GPU.1 and etc.


### Option 2: Install from Source

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing the Helm chart:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries.git edge-ai-libraries
```

#### Step 2: Change to the Chart Directory

Navigate to the chart directory:

```bash
cd edge-ai-libraries/sample-applications/chat-question-and-answer-core/chart
```

#### Step 3: Configure the `values.yaml` File

Edit the `values.yaml` file located in the chart directory to set the necessary environment variables. Refer to the table in **Option 1, Step 3** for the list of keys and example values.

#### Step 4: Build Helm Dependencies

Navigate to the chart directory and build the Helm dependencies using the following command:

```bash
helm dependency build
```

## Common Steps after configuration

### Step 5: Deploy the Helm Chart

Deploy the Chat Question-and-Answer Core Helm chart:

```bash
helm install chatqna-core . --namespace <your-namespace>
```

### Step 6: Verify the Deployment

Check the status of the deployed resources to ensure everything is running correctly

```bash
kubectl get pods -n <your-namespace>
kubectl get services -n <your-namespace>
```

### Step 7: Access the Application

Open the UI in a browser at http://\<node-ip\>:\<ui-node-port\>

### Step 8: Update Helm Dependencies

If any changes are made to the subcharts, update the Helm dependencies using the following command:

```bash
helm dependency update
```
### Step 9: Uninstall Helm chart

To uninstall helm charts deployed, use the following command:

```bash
helm uninstall <name> -n <your-namespace>
```

## Verification

- Ensure that all pods are running and the services are accessible.
- Access the application dashboard and verify that it is functioning as expected.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during the deployment process, check the Kubernetes logs for errors:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs <pod_name>
  ```
- If the PVC created during a Helm chart deployment is not removed or auto-deleted due to a deployment failure or being stuck, it must be deleted manually using the following commands:
  ```bash
  # List the PVCs present in the given namespace
  kubectl get pvc -n <namespace>

  # Delete the required PVC from the namespace
  kubectl delete pvc <pvc-name> -n <namespace>
  ```
