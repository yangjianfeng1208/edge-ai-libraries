# System Requirements
This section provides detailed hardware, software, and platform requirements to help you set up and run the application efficiently.


## Hardware Platforms Used for Validation
- Intel® Xeon® processor: Fourth and fifth generation.
- Intel® Core™ processor: Core Ultra 7 Processor 265 and Core Ultra 9 Processor 285.

## Operating Systems Used for Validation
- Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS OS for Intel Xeon configurations only.

## Minimum Configuration
Intel recommends the minimum memory configuration of 64 GB, and minimum storage of 128 GB. Further requirements is dependent on the specific configuration of the application like KV cache, context size, and etc. If the default parameters of the sample application are changed, you must assess the memory and storage implications.

If the model configuration is reduced, you can reduce the memory size to 32 GB. If you need support for smaller configurations, raise an issue through the GitHub repository.

## Software Requirements

The software requirements to install the sample application are provided in other documentation pages and is not repeated here.

## Compatibility Notes

**Known Limitations**:
- None
