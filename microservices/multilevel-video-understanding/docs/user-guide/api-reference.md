      "description": "Large Language Models for summarization",
      "display_name": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B-AWQ",
      "model_id": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B-AWQ"
    }
  ],

## 3. Summarization API

**POST /v1/summary**

**Description:**
Generate a summary text from a video file to describe its content.

**Request Parameters**
Request parameters for the summarization endpoint

- **video**: *Required.*. Path to the video file, support 'file:/', 'http://', 'https://' and local path.
- **prompt**: *Optional*. User prompt to guide summarization details.
- **method**: *Optional*. Summarization method, choices: ["SIMPLE", "USE_VLM_T-1", "USE_LLM_T-1", "USE_ALL_T-1"]. Default as *"USE_ALL_T-1"*. Each method definition: 
    - **SIMPLE**: Simple summarization, do not incorporate time dependency between consecutive chunks
    - **USE_VLM_T-1**: Incorporate time dependency between consecutive chunks for VLM inference.
    - **USE_LLM_T-1**: Incorporate time dependency between consecutive chunks for LLM inference.
    - **USE_ALL_T-1**: Incorporate time dependency between consecutive chunks for both VLM and LLM inference.
- **processor_kwargs**: *Optional*. Summarization processing parameters. Currently supported items:
    - **process_fps**: Extract frames at process_fps for input video. Default as *1*.
    - **levels**: Specify total levels for hierarchical summarization. Default as *3*.
    - **level_sizes**: Specify chunk group size for each level, must match with `levels`. Default as *[1, 6, -1]*, -1 means using single group at the level.
    - **chunking_method**: video chunking algorithm, choices: ["pelt", "uniform"], Default as *"pelt"*. Call video-chunking-utils with specific method, pelt with scene-switch based video chunking; uniform with 15s duration for video chunking. 

**Response**
A response with the processing status and summary output.

**Response Example Value**

- Successful Response. Code: 200

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "summary": "string",
  "message": "string",

  "video_duration": 0
}
```

- Bad Request. Code: 400
```json
{
  "details": "Invalid file format",
  "error_message": "Summarization failed!"
}
```

- Internal Server Error. Code: 500
```json
{
    "details":"An error occurred during Summarization. Please check logs for details.",
    "error_message":"Summarization failed!"
