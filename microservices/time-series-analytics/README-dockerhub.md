# Time Series Analytics Microservice

It is a powerful, flexible solution for real-time analysis of time series data. Built on top of Kapacitor, it enables both streaming and batch processing, seamlessly integrating with InfluxDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.

> **Note**:
As this docker image is using ubuntu packages coming from Kapacitor base docker image, please note that the usage
of this docker image is intended for demo purposes only and not intended for production use. To receive expanded 
security maintenance from Canonical on the Ubuntu base layer, you may follow the [how-to guide to enable Ubuntu Pro
in a Dockerfile](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/pro-client/en/docs/howtoguides/enable_in_dockerfile/) which require the image to be rebuilt
