# Overview and Architecture

Deep Learning Streamer Pipeline Server (DL Streamer Pipeline Server) is a Python-based, interoperable containerized microservice for easy development and deployment of video analytics pipelines. It is built on top of [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/) and [Deep Learning Streamer (DL Streamer)](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/blob/main/libraries/dl-streamer/docs/source/index.md), providing video ingestion and deep learning inferencing functionalities.
