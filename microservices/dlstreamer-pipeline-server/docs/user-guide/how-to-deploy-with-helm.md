# How to Deploy with Helm

-   **Time to Complete:** 5 - 15 minutes
-   **Programming Language:** Python 3

## Prerequisites

- [System Requirements](./system-requirements.md)
- K8s installation on single or multi node must be done as pre-requisite to continue the following deployment. Note: The kubernetes cluster is set up with `kubeadm`, `kubectl` and `kubelet` packages on single and multi nodes with `v1.30.2`.
  Refer to tutorials such as <https://adamtheautomator.com/install-kubernetes-ubuntu> and many other
  online tutorials to setup kubernetes cluster on the web with host OS as ubuntu 22.04.
- For helm installation, refer to [helm website](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- Clone the Edge-AI-Libraries repository from open edge platform and change to the helm directory inside DL Streamer Pipeline Server project.

  ```sh
    cd [WORKDIR]
    git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries.git
    cd edge-ai-libraries/microservices/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/helm
    ```

## Quick try out
Follow the steps in this section to quickly pull the latest pre-built DL Streamer Pipeline Server helm charts followed by running a sample usecase.

### Pull the helm chart (Optional)

- Note: The helm chart should be downloaded when you are not using the helm chart provided in `edge-ai-libraries/microservices/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/helm`

- Download helm chart with the following command

    `helm pull oci://registry-1.docker.io/intel/dlstreamer-pipeline-server --version 3.1.0-helm`
- unzip the package using the following command

    `tar -xvf dlstreamer-pipeline-server-3.1.0-helm.tgz`
- Get into the helm directory

    `cd dlstreamer-pipeline-server`

### Configure and update the environment variables

Update the below fields in `values.yaml` file in the helm chart

  ``` sh
  env:
    http_proxy: # example: http_proxy: http://proxy.example.com:891
    https_proxy: # example: http_proxy: http://proxy.example.com:891
  images:
    dlstreamer_pipeline_server: # example: dlstreamer_pipeline_server: intel/dlstreamer-pipeline-server:3.1.0-ubuntu22
  ```

### Install the helm chart

- Install the helm chart

    `helm install dlsps . -n apps --create-namespace`
- Check if DL Streamer Pipeline Server is running fine

    `kubectl get pods --namespace apps`and monitor its logs using `kubectl logs -f <pod_name> -n apps`

### Run default sample

Once the pods are up, we will send a pipeline request to DL Streamer Pipeline Server to run a detection model on a warehouse video.
The resources such as video and model are copied into `dlstreamer-pipeline-server` pod by `initContainers`.

We will send the below curl request to run the inference.
It comprises of a source file path which is `warehouse.avi`, a destination, with metadata directed to a json file in `/tmp/resuts.jsonl` and frames streamed over RTSP with id `pallet_defect_detection`. Additionally, we will also provide the GETi model path that would be used for detecting defective boxes on the video file.

Open another terminal and send the following curl request
```sh
  curl http://localhost:30007/pipelines/user_defined_pipelines/pallet_defect_detection -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
    "source": {
      "uri": "file:///home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/warehouse.avi",
      "type": "uri"
    },
    "destination": {
      "metadata": {
        "type": "file",
        "path": "/tmp/results.jsonl",
        "format": "json-lines"
      },
      "frame": {
        "type": "rtsp",
        "path": "pallet_defect_detection"
      }
    },
    "parameters": {
      "detection-properties": {
        "model": "/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/geti/pallet_defect_detection/deployment/Detection/model/model.xml",
        "device": "CPU"
      }
    }
  }'
```

The REST request will return a pipeline instance ID, which can be used as an identifier to query later the pipeline status or stop the pipeline instance. For example, a6d67224eacc11ec9f360242c0a86003.

- To view the metadata, open another terminal and run the following command,
  ```sh
    tail -f /tmp/results.jsonl
  ```

- RTSP Stream will be accessible at `rtsp://<SYSTEM_IP_ADDRESS>:30025/pallet_defect_detection`.  Users can view this on any media player e.g. vlc (as a network stream), ffplay etc

  ![sample frame RTSP stream](./images/sample-pallet-defect-detection.png)

To check the pipeline status and stop the pipeline send the following requests,

 - view the pipeline status that you triggered in the above step.
   ```sh
    curl --location -X GET http://localhost:30007/pipelines/status
   ```

 - stop a running pipeline instance,
   ```sh
    curl --location -X DELETE http://localhost:30007/pipelines/{instance_id}
   ```

 - Uninstall the helm chart,
   ```sh
    helm uninstall dlsps -n apps
   ```

Now you have successfully run the DL Streamer Pipeline Server container, sent a curl request to start a pipeline within the microservice which runs the Geti based pallet defect detection model on a sample warehouse video. Then, you have also looked into the status of the pipeline to see if everything worked as expected and eventually stopped the pipeline as well.
