# Get Started

-   **Time to Complete:** 5 - 15 minutes
-   **Programming Language:** Python 3

## Prerequisites

* [System Requirements](./system-requirements.md)
  
## Quick try out
Follow the steps in this section to quickly pull the latest pre-built DL Streamer Pipeline Server docker image followed by running a sample usecase. 

### Pull the image and start container

- Clone the Edge-AI-Libraries repository from open edge platform and change to the docker directory inside DL Streamer Pipeline Server project.

  ```sh
    cd [WORKDIR]
    git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries.git -b release-1.2.0
    cd edge-ai-libraries/microservices/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/docker
    ```

- Pull the image with the latest tag from docker registry

   ```sh
     # Update DLSTREAMER_PIPELINE_SERVER_IMAGE in <edge-ai-libraries/microservices/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/docker/.env> if necessary
     docker pull "$(grep ^DLSTREAMER_PIPELINE_SERVER_IMAGE= .env | cut -d= -f2-)"
   ```

- Bring up the container

   ```sh
     docker compose up
   ```
   
### Run default sample

Once the container is up, we will send a pipeline request to DL Streamer pipeline server to run a detection model on a warehouse video. Both the model and video are provided as default sample in the docker image.

We will send the below curl request to run the inference.
It comprises of a source file path which is `warehouse.avi`, a destination, with metadata directed to a json fine in `/tmp/resuts.jsonl` and frames streamed over RTSP with id `pallet_defect_detection`. Additionally, we will also provide the GETi model path that would be used for detecting defective boxes on the video file.

Open another terminal and send the following curl request
``` sh
    curl http://localhost:8080/pipelines/user_defined_pipelines/pallet_defect_detection -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
    "source": {
        "uri": "file:///home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/warehouse.avi",
        "type": "uri"
    },
    "destination": {
        "metadata": {
            "type": "file",
            "path": "/tmp/results.jsonl",
            "format": "json-lines"
        },
        "frame": {
            "type": "rtsp",
            "path": "pallet_defect_detection"
        }
    },
    "parameters": {
        "detection-properties": {
            "model": "/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/geti/pallet_defect_detection/deployment/Detection/model/model.xml",
            "device": "CPU"
        }
    }
}'
```

The REST request will return a pipeline instance ID, which can be used as an identifier to query later the pipeline status or stop the pipeline instance. For example, a6d67224eacc11ec9f360242c0a86003.

- To view the metadata, open another terminal and run the following command,
  ```sh
    tail -f /tmp/results.jsonl
  ```

- RTSP Stream will be accessible at `rtsp://<SYSTEM_IP_ADDRESS>:8554/pallet_defect_detection`.  Users can view this on any media player e.g. vlc (as a network stream), ffplay etc 

  ![sample frame RTSP stream](./images/sample-pallet-defect-detection.png)

To check the pipeline status and stop the pipeline send the following requests,

 - view the pipeline status that you triggered in the above step.
   ```sh
    curl --location -X GET http://localhost:8080/pipelines/status
   ```

 - stop a running pipeline instance, 
   ```sh
    curl --location -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/pipelines/{instance_id}
   ```

Now you have successfully run the DL Streamer Pipeline Server container, sent a curl request to start a pipeline within the microservice which runs the Geti based pallet defect detection model on a sample warehouse video. Then, you have also looked into the status of the pipeline to see if everything worked as expected and eventually stopped the pipeline as well.
