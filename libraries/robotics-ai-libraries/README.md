# Robotics AI Libraries

The Robotics AI Libraries provides reusable libraries spanning optimized math utilities, robotic compatibility layers, and robotic vision.

## Collection

| Library | Documentation | Description |
| ------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| [FLANN optimized with oneAPI DPC++](flann) | [Link](flann/README.md) | FLANN is a 3-D processing library used to search for nearest neighbors in three-dimensional or even higher dimensional space. |
| [Motion Control Gateway](motion-control-gateway) | [Link](motion-control-gateway/README.md) | Communication gateway between Real-Time Motion Control system and ROS2(Robot Operating System 2) system. |
| [ORB Extractor](orb-extractor) | [Link](orb-extractor/README.md) | The ORB feature extractor comprises various computer vision (CV) kernels such as resize, Gaussian, FAST, compute descriptor, and orientation, along with non-CV functions like distribute_keypoints_via_tree. |
| [PCL optimized with oneAPI DPC++](pcl) | [Link](pcl/README.md) | Point-Cloud Library (PCL) contains common algorithms for 3-D point cloud processing. |
