RTmotion Concept and Application Interface
==========================================

The PLCopen motion standard provides a way to have standard and modular application libraries that are reusable for multiple industrial automation scenarios, such as PLC motion control, CNC and robotics. For more detailed information of the PLCopen motion specifications, please refer to `Motion Control <https://plcopen.org/technical-activities/motion-control>`_.

1. RTmotion Overview
####################

The motion control market displays a wide variety of incompatible systems and solutions. In businesses where different systems are used, this incompatibility induces considerable costs for the end-users, learning is confusing, engineering becomes difficult, and the process of market growth slows down. Standardization would certainly reduce these negative factors. Standardization means not only the programming languages themselves, (as standardization is achieved using the worldwide IEC 61131-3 standard) but also standardizing the interface towards different motion control solutions. In this way the programming of these motion control solutions is less hardware dependent. The reusability of the application software is increased, and the costs involved in training and support are reduced.

**RTmotion** is an C++ library created by Intel Corporation. **RTmotion** implements part of the single axis motion control function blocks defined in parts `1&2 <https://plcopen.org/downloads/plcopen-motion-control-part-1-version-20>`_, `3 <https://plcopen.org/downloads/plcopen-motion-control-part-3-version-20>`_ and `5 <https://plcopen.org/downloads/plcopen-motion-control-part-5-version-20>`_ of PLCopen motion control standard. The figure below shows the connections between **RTmotion** and other components in |ECI|.

**RTmotion** is a library designed to match the interfaces and functions of the function blocks defined in PLCopen standard. It is not tied to any operating system, fieldbus, SoftPLC or applications. But it needs to run in a real-time thread to have steady cycle and gain maximum performance. So the real-time operating systems are the base foundation for RTmotion to run on. As figure above shows, |ECI| provides two types of real-time operating systems (Preempt RT, Xenomai) that RTmotion can fit in.

RTmotion provides functions and algorithms for performing motion control tasks according to the PLCopen standard. It requires reading status from servo motors and outputting motion commands to them. The bridge between RTmotion and servo motors is implemented in a hardware abstraction layer called **plcopen-servo**. It is based on a servo template that can be populated by different fieldbus communication stack interfaces to derive the servo motor of a specific fieldbus type. As shown in the figure, |ECI| provides two types of servo layers (CANopen and EtherCAT). Details of plcopen-servo are covered in level-2.

RTmotion's functional blocks often play the role of basic modules that can be integrated like Lego blocks to create complex applications. The C++ API of RTmotion can be called in different ways:

  - Called in a C++ application: |ECI| provides examples in **plcopen-servo** and **plcopen-databus** repositories for reference.
  - Integrated in a SoftPLC runtime: RTmotion has been integrated in several commercial and open-source SoftPLC runtime. See the list below.

    * WASM (`Further reading for WASM <https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime>`_)
    * LogicLab (`Further reading for LogicLab + RTmotion <https://www.nxtrol.com/h-nd-25.html>`_)
    * OpenPLC (`Further reading for OpenPLC + RTmotion <https://eci.intel.com/docs/3.1/components/openplc.html>`_)
    * |EAE| (`WIP, further reading for EAE <https://www.se.com/us/en/product-range/23643079-ecostruxure-automation-expert/#overview>`_).

RTmotion provides basic trajectory interpolation and motion control in real-time tasks synchronized with the servo motor cycle time. As shown in the right part of the figure, the real-time tasks usually require to communicate with some non-real-time software (advanced robotics motion planning, SCADA HMI, CNC and machine vision) in some application scenarios. It can be realized by using a communication layer in the databus form of Shared-Memory, Modbus, Socket, ZeroMQ, MQTT, OPCUA, etc.

   <p align="center"><b>Figure 2. ECI motion configurations for Atom or Core CPU</b></p>

As shown in the figure above, RTmotion can be set up to run with an |Atom| or |Core| CPU in three configurations:

- **ECI-B (Bare-metal)**:

  * OS: Host (Preempt-RT/Xenomai)
  * One CPU core is isolated and dedicated for RTmotion real-time task.
  * Rest CPU cores and iGPU are used for non-real-time HMI/MV tasks.
- **ECI-K (KVM)**:

  * OS: Host (Preempt-RT), Guest VM (|Windows|)
  * One CPU core is isolated and dedicated for RTmotion real-time task.
  * One CPU core is used for host |Linux| tasks.
  * Rest CPU cores and iGPU are used for Guest VM.
- **ECI-A (ACRN)**:

  * OS: Service OS (|Linux|), Guest VM1 (|Windows|), Guest VM2 (Preempt-RT/Xenomai)
  * Two CPU cores are isolated and dedicated for Guest VM2. Among them, one is dedicated for RTmotion real-time task.

   <p align="center"><b>Figure 3. ECI motion configuration for hybrid CPU</b></p>

- The 12th generation of |Intel| CPUs integrate Performance (P) and Efficient (E) cores. For example the ADL-S which has 8 P-core and 4 E-core. For best performance, real-time RTmotion tasks should run in a real-time VM running on an E-core. P-cores are used to run |Windows| VMs for non-real-time HMI/machine vision workloads. In this configuration, the P-core can support hyper-threading and hardware P-state features without sacrificing the real-time performance of the E-core:

  * OS: Service OS (|Linux|), Guest VM1 (|Windows|), Guest VM2 (Preempt-RT/Xenomai), Guest VM3 (Preempt-RT/Xenomai)
  * Two E-core are dedicated for Guest VM2.
  * Two E-core are dedicated for Guest VM3.
  * One P-core is shared by Service OS and Guest VM1.
  * Rest P-core and iGPU are used for Guest VM1.

3. RTmotion Applications
########################

This section lists some of the RTmotion applications in the industrial automation domains. It shows how |ECI| with RTmotion enables customers to consolidate their real-time (motion control) and non-real-time (HMI/Machine Vision/CNC/ROS2 Robotics) workloads.

3.1. Logistics control
++++++++++++++++++++++

.. image:: ../assets/app/rtmotion_app_1.png
   :width: 85%
   :align: center

.. raw:: html

   <p align="center"><b>Figure 4. RTmotion application for parcel singulation controller</b></p>

In this project, RTmotion enables customers to consolidate their machine vision and real-time motion control workloads to run on an |Intel| x86 platform. This application scenario is very common in logistics. Parcel separation controllers typically consist of two separate systems: a PLC connected to the 28~84 conveyor EtherCAT servo motors for speed control, and a |Windows| IPC for parcel pose detection and servo motor speed planning. The results of the speed planning will be transmitted to the PLC via TCP/IP socket communication. As shown above, |ECI| solutions combine both functions into one platform. There will be an |ECI| Preempt RT |Linux| OS running as the host. A CPU core is then isolated to run real-time RTmotion tasks to control servo motors, which in traditional solutions plays the role of a PLC. KVM is used here as the hypervisor to support running |Windows| guest VMs on |Linux| hosts. |Windows| applications can be migrated to the guest VM without any modification.

3.2. SMT machine control with flying-trigger
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. raw:: html

   <p align="center"><b>Figure 5. RTmotion application for flying-trigger</b></p>

In this project, the RTmotion function block has been integrated into |EAE| for motion control of SMT manufacturing. The project also integrated |ECI| flying-trigger technique and |EII| to improve vision capture and detection efficiency. The key components are listed here:

- |Intel| RTmotion for motion control
- |ECI| for real-time environment and fieldbus
- |EII| for vision modules and message bus
- |Intel| TGPIO for high frequency real-time I/O trigger
- |EAE| for runtime, PLC programming and central management

3.3. 100-axis control with |EAE|
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   :width: 85%
   :align: center

.. raw:: html

   <p align="center"><b>Figure 6. RTmotion application for multiple axis control</b></p>

Coating, winding and stacking machines in Li-battery manufacturing often require real-time synchronization between hundreds of axes and multiple functions (CamIn, GearIn, velocity and torque control, etc.). |ECI| with RTmotion has demonstrated the capability to meet this requirements, that controlling 100 EtherCAT servo motors within 1ms cycle time with a maximum real-time latency of 15us. The RTmotion is also integrated in |EAE| in this project.

3.4. AMR control
++++++++++++++++

.. image:: ../assets/app/rtmotion_app_4.png
   :width: 85%
   :align: center

.. raw:: html

   <p align="center"><b>Figure 7. RTmotion application for AMR control</b></p>

AMR (Autonomous Mobile Robot) is now widely used in warehouses, logistical companies, agriculture businesses, and healthcare institutions. AMR typically consists of two independent hardware control systems: one for real-time motion control and another for SLAM/path planning/vision. Since AMR usually only needs to drive less than 4 servo motors with low accuracy velocity control, and the kinematics and dynamics model for the whole-body control are simpler compared to that of a 6-axis robot arm, the low-end computing unit is sufficient to complete the real-time motion control. With |ECI| and RTmotion, it is quite reasonable and easy to integrate two independent systems, from which customers can benefit from reduced hardware costs, higher reliability, system flexibility and easy upgrades. As shown in the figure above, one CPU core can be isolated to run RTmotion tasks to drive mobile platforms. Both CANopen and EtherCAT based servo motors are supported. ROS2 tasks can utilize remaining CPU and system resources to implement SLAM/path planning/vision functions. Buttons, safety sensors and other I/O devices can be easily controlled via remote IO modules based on CANBus, EtherCAT or Modbus.

3.5. Robot arm control
++++++++++++++++++++++

   :width: 85%
   :align: center

.. raw:: html

   <p align="center"><b>Figure 8. RTmotion application for robot arm control</b></p>

Similar to the concept of AMR, the robotic arm control workloads can also be consolidated by |ECI| with RTmotion. With the development of machine vision, AI and advanced motion planning technique, new type of intelligent robot arm controllers have been widely used. However, this intelligent controller is often separated from the robot arm's native controller, which is only responsible for real-time motion control. This increases the difficulty of system adaptation. At the same time, in recent years, there has been a trend in the industry to consolidate PLC control, real-time motion control of robotic arms, machine vision and HMI into one controller to support the overall development of automated workstations.

3.6. Inspection machine control
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. raw:: html

   <p align="center"><b>Figure 9. RTmotion application for inspection machine</b></p>

Patches provided by |ECI| have integrated RTmotion into the IDE and runtime of Open Source SoftPLC (OpenPLC). Customers can do IEC 61131-3 PLC programming for motion control as they normally do on traditional PLC products. Through the RTmotion configuration introduced in Chapter 2, customers can customize the PC-based SoftPLC controller according to their needs. Since most non-standard automation equipment only requires PTP movement, RTmotion's function blocks MC_MoveAbsolute, MC_Homing, and MC_MoveRelative can meet these usage scenarios. As shown in the figure above, the customer migrated all the functions of the PLC in the Li-battery Hipot test device to the PC-based soft PLC controller through |ECI| and RTmotion. This helps customers reduce hardware costs and makes the entire system IT-friendly.

4.5. MC_MoveAdditive
++++++++++++++++++++

This Function Block commands a controlled motion of a specified relative distance additional to the most recent commanded position in the axis state **DiscreteMotion**. The most recent commanded position may be the result of a previous MC_MoveAdditive motion which was aborted. If the FB is activated in the axis state **ContinuousMotion**, the
specified relative distance is added to the set position at the time of the execution.

4.6. MC_MoveSuperimposed
++++++++++++++++++++++++

This Function Block Commands a controlled motion of a specified relative distance additional to an existing motion. The existing Motion is not interrupted, but is superimposed by the additional motion.

Behavior when active:

- If MC_MoveSuperimposed is active, then any other command in aborting mode except MC_MoveSuperimposed will abort both motion commands: both the MC_MoveSuperimposed and the underlying motion command.
- If MC_MoveSuperimposed is active and another MC_MoveSuperimposed is commanded, only the on-going MC_MoveSuperimposed command is aborted, and replaced by the new MC_MoveSuperimposed, but not the underlying motion command.
- If MC_MoveSuperimposed is active, then any new added FB will abort underlying and on-going superimposed motion.
- In the state 'Standstill' the FB MC_MoveSuperimposed acts like MC_MoveRelative.

4.8. MC_Homing
++++++++++++++

This Function Block commands the axis to perform the 'search home' sequence. The details of this sequence are
manufacturer dependent. RTmotion MC_Homing FB takes the current position as the home position when comes across
the rising edge of AbsoluteSwitchSignal in the search direction or the falling edge of the signal in the
diverse direction. Since the velocity can not be decelerated to zero when the absolute signal is triggered, this
function block will decelerate and return back to stop at the home position.

4.12. MC_Power
++++++++++++++

This Function Block controls the power stage (On or Off). The power-on process depends on the fieldbus protocol content.
For example, if RTmotion is connected to a CiA402 EtherCAT servo motor, the power-on process switches the servo motor
state to "Operation Enabled" state. It also resolves situations where state switching encounters errors or exceptions,
or the servo motor reports an error when an electrical or physical condition occurs.

4.14. MC_SetPosition
++++++++++++++++++++

This Function Block shifts the coordinate system of an axis by manipulating both the set-point position as well as the
actual position of an axis with the same value without any movement caused. (Re-calibration with same following error).
This can be used for instance for a reference situation. This Function Block can also be used during motion without
changing the commanded position, which is now positioned in the shifted coordinate system.

- ``mcSetPositionModeRelative``: means that 'Position' is added to the actual position value of the axis at the time of execution. This results in a re-calibration by a specified distance.
- ``mcSetPositionModeAbsolute``: means that the actual position value of the axis is set to the value specified in the 'Position' parameter.

The FB gives access to the input value of the IO module. It provides the mcBOOL value of the specified Input bit
of the referenced IO_REF object. The VAR_IN_OUT object 'Input' specifies the IO module and numbers its inputs from
0 in ascending address order. The VAR_INPUT 'InputNumber' specifies the input number and the VAR_INPUT 'BitNumber'
specifies the bit number of this input.

For example, if the 'Input' is set to my_io, the 'InputNumber' is set to 0, and the 'BitNumber' is set to 0, then
the VAR_OUTPUT 'Value' will return the mcBOOL value of the first bit of the first input in the my_io object  while
the VAR_OUTPUT 'Valid' is mcTrue.

4.26. MC_ReadDigitalOutput
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The FB gives access to the output value of the IO module. It provides the mcBOOL value of the specified Output bit
of the referenced IO_REF object. The VAR_IN_OUT object 'Output' specifies the IO module and numbers its outputs from
0 in ascending address order. The VAR_INPUT 'OutputNumber' specifies the output number and the VAR_INPUT 'BitNumber'
specifies the bit number of this output.

For example, if the 'Output' is set to my_io, the 'OutputNumber' is set to 0, and the 'BitNumber' is set to 0, then
the VAR_OUTPUT 'Value' will return the mcBOOL value of the first bit of the first output in the my_io object while
the VAR_OUTPUT 'Valid' is mcTrue.

4.27. MC_WriteDigitalOutput
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The FB writes a mcBOOL value to the output bit referenced by the argument ‘Output’.The VAR_IN_OUT object 'Output'
specifies the IO module and numbers its outputs from 0 in ascending address order. The VAR_INPUT 'OutputNumber'
specifies the output number and the VAR_INPUT 'BitNumber' specifies the bit number of this output.

For example, if the 'Output' is set to my_io, the 'OutputNumber' is set to 0, the 'BitNumber' is set to 0, and the
'Value' is set to mcTrue, then this FB will set the first bit of the first output in the my_io object to mcTrue after
the VAR_OUTPUT 'Done' is mcTrue.

4.28. MC_SetControllerMode
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This function block, if supported by the drive, can be used to switch to another controller mode. Preconditions:

- The axis must support the desired controlling mode. In order to check this, see the feature documentation PDF inside the corresponding SoftMotion driver library.
- The needed cyclic I/O data (e.g. for torque mode: set torque object) must be mapped.
- The axis must NOT be in the state ``mcErrorStop``, ``mcStopping`` or ``mcHoming`` when this function block is called. Else, an error ``mcErrorCodeSetControllerModeInvalidState`` will be reported.

Behavior when active:

- If this does not happen during 1000 cycles, the function block will abort with an error.
- All FBs should be aborted when the mode is changed from high level to the low level. (high level: position & velocity; low level: torque). Switch home to other mode also need to abort all FBs.

+----------------+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


4.33.2 Definition of MasterAbsolute
-----------------------------------

* ``MasterAbsolute=TRUE``

  + The cam is started at the current master position.
  + If Periodic=True, master position will be evaluated by modulo operations of the master value range.
* ``MasterAbsolute=FALSE``

  + Sets the zero point of the master to the current master position or to the position at the end of the previous cam.
  + The MasterAbsolute=FALSE mode may be used only if the value 0 is in the master value range because the evaluation of the cam is started at this position.

+--------------------+---------------------------------+-------------------------------+


4.33.4 Definition of StartMode
------------------------------

* ``StartMode = mcAbsolute``

  + When starting a new cycle, the cam is evaluated independent of the current position of the slave. This can lead to jumps if the slave position to the master start position deviates from that of the master end position.
* ``StartMode = mcRelative``

  + The new cam is started allowing for the current slave position. The position that the slave has after the end of the previous cycle is added as a slave offset to the new evaluations of the cam. Jumps can also occur if the slave position at the master start position is not 0.

With BufferMode Aborting, any previous motion is continued until the master crosses the position MasterSyncPosition - MasterStartDistance in the correct direction. At that point in time the output StartSync is set. When a stop command is executed on the slave axis before the synchronization has happened, it will inhibit the synchronization and the function block issues CommandAborted = TRUE.

If the MasterStartDistance is not specified (indicated by a non-positive value), the function block calculates the setting start distance point so that synchronization starts at the current master position.

1. RTmotion trajectory planning
###############################

Servo motors running in Cyclic Synchronous Position Mode (CSP), Cyclic Synchronous Velocity Mode (CSV) or Cyclic Synchronous Torque Mode (CST) mode need to receive commands in real-time cycle time, such as 1ms cycle time. This requires trajectory planning algorithms to interpolate in delta time interval same to the cycle time.

5.1. S-curve trajectory planning
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

S-curve trajectory planning is one algorithm used by the PLCopen function blocks for single axis trajectory interpolation. When driving a motor to an absolute or additive position, the motors always try to accelerate its velocity to its maximum value and decelerate before it reaches the target position. If the acceleration during this process is not continuous or linear piece-wise, some infinite jerk spikes may happen, which can cause efforts and stresses on the mechanical system of motors that results in detrimental or undesired vibrational effects. Therefore, the S-curve trajectory planning is necessary.

A sample implementation of the S-curve algorithm is provided in ECI for reference design. For more information of S-curve planning, refer to "Trajectory Planning for Automatic Machines and Robots-Springer (2008)" by *Luigi Biagiotti, Claudio Melchiorri*.

6. RTmotion C++ example
#######################

This section provides examples of how to call RTmotion functions in C++ applications.

6.1. Build RTmotion
+++++++++++++++++++

At the first step, build and install Ruckig:

.. code-block:: bash

      git clone -b v0.9.2 https://github.com/pantor/ruckig.git
      cd ruckig
      mkdir build && cd build
      cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
      make
      sudo make install

Build RTmotion and its minimum example:

.. code-block:: bash

      cd <RTmotion directory>
      mkdir build & cd build
      # For the next step, pick one of the two options:
      # - Option 1: If build on PREEMPT Linux, run the next command
      cmake ..
      # - Option 2: If build on Xenomai, run the next command
      cmake .. -DCOBALT=ON -DXENOMAI_DIR=/usr/xenomai
      make

6.2. Run RTmotion minimum example
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The RTmotion minimum example shows how to run RTmotion function blocks (MC_Power, MC_MoveRelative, MC_ReadActualPosition, MC_ReadActualVelocity) on a virtual axis. The program uses MC_Power to power on the axis. Then it uses MC_MoveRelative to move the axis to a distance with 200 units relative to the current position (by default 0 at start time). When the MC_MoveRelative is done, a negative 200 units distance is set and the MC_MoveRelative is re-triggered to move the axis back to its original position.

.. code-block:: bash

      # A runable should has already been build in this folder
      cd <RTmotion directory>/build/src

      # Argument parameters:
      #   -c : Index of CPU core isolated for real-time tasks
      #   -t : The expected time to run this example (s)
      taskset -c <CPUID> multi-axis -t <running time in seconds>

This is the source code for a minimal example, code explanation has been added via comments.

6.3. Run RTmotion with EtherCAT servo
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Running RTmotion with EtherCAT servos needs to replace the virtual servo ``RTmotion::Servo`` with a EtherCAT servo ``RTmotion::EcrtServo``, which can be derived from ``RTmotion::Servo`` as shown here:

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <fb/common/include/Servo.hpp>

    namespace RTmotion
    {
    class Servo
    {
    public:
      Servo();
      virtual ~Servo();
      virtual MC_SERVO_ERROR_CODE setPower(mcBOOL powerStatus, mcBOOL& isDone);
      virtual MC_SERVO_ERROR_CODE setPos(mcDINT pos);
      virtual MC_SERVO_ERROR_CODE setVel(mcDINT vel);
      virtual MC_SERVO_ERROR_CODE setTorque(mcLREAL torque);
      virtual MC_SERVO_ERROR_CODE setMaxProfileVel(mcDWORD vel);
      virtual MC_SERVO_ERROR_CODE setMode(mcSINT mode);
      virtual MC_SERVO_ERROR_CODE setHomeEnable(mcBOOL enable);
      virtual mcDINT pos();
      virtual mcDINT vel();
      virtual mcDINT acc();
      virtual mcLREAL torque();
      virtual mcSINT mode();
      virtual mcBOOL getHomeState();
      virtual mcBOOL readVal(mcDINT index, mcLREAL& value);
      virtual mcBOOL writeVal(mcDINT index, mcLREAL value);
      virtual mcBOOL readVal(mcUINT index, mcUSINT sub_index, mcUSINT data_length,
                            mcUDINT& value);
      virtual mcBOOL writeVal(mcUINT index, mcUSINT sub_index, mcUSINT data_length,
                              mcUDINT value);
      virtual MC_SERVO_ERROR_CODE resetError(mcBOOL& isDone);
      virtual void runCycle(mcLREAL freq);
      virtual void emergStop();

    private:
      class ServoImpl
      {
      public:
        mcDINT mSubmitPos     = 0;
        mcDINT mPos           = 0;
        mcLREAL mVel          = 0;
        mcLREAL mAcc          = 0;
        mcLREAL mTorque       = 0;

        mcSINT mode           = 0;
        mcBOOL mHomeEnable    = mcFALSE;
        mcBOOL mHomeState     = mcFALSE;
      };
      ServoImpl mImpl_;
    };
    }  // namespace RTmotion

Refer to the following instructions when writing the servo interface:

.. cpp:function::  MC_SERVO_ERROR_CODE setPower(mcBOOL powerStatus, mcBOOL& isDone)

    Set the power state of the servo motor:

    - ``powerStatus``: Set `true` for Power ON; `false` for Power OFF.
    - ``isDone``: Set `true` if the operation of Power ON/OFF is completed, otherwise set as `false` and wait to be called in the next cycle.
    - ``return``: If error occurs, returns a user-defined error code, otherwise returns 0. (MC_ServoErrorCode is ``uint32_t``)

.. cpp:function::  MC_SERVO_ERROR_CODE setPos(mcDINT pos)

    Set a position goal to the servo motor (only used in position control mode).

    - ``pos``: Position goal in the unit of encoder (raw_unit).
    - ``return``: If error occurs, returns a user-defined error code, otherwise returns 0.

.. cpp:function::  MC_SERVO_ERROR_CODE setVel(mcDINT vel)

    Set a velocity goal to the servo motor (only used in velocity control mode).

    - ``vel``: Velocity goal in the unit of raw_unit/sec.
    - ``return``: If error occurs, returns a user-defined error code, otherwise returns 0.

.. cpp:function::  MC_SERVO_ERROR_CODE setTorque(mcLREAL torque)

    - ``torque``: Torque goal in the unit of N/m.
    - ``return``: If error occurs, returns a user-defined error code, otherwise returns 0.

.. cpp:function::  MC_SERVO_ERROR_CODE setMaxProfileVel(mcDWORD vel)

    - ``vel``: Set the max velocity for torque control (only work for Innovance servo motors).
    - ``return``: If error occurs, returns a user-defined error code, otherwise returns 0.

.. cpp:function::  MC_SERVO_ERROR_CODE setMode(mcSINT mode)

    - ``mode``: The control mode to be set (mcServoDriveModeCSP/mcServoDriveModeCSV/mcServoDriveModeCST). Please see global.h for reference.
    - ``return``: If error occurs, returns a user-defined error code, otherwise returns 0.

.. cpp:function::  MC_SERVO_ERROR_CODE setHomeEnable(mcBOOL enable)

    - ``enable``: Start servo homing process.
    - ``return``: If error occurs, returns a user-defined error code, otherwise returns 0.

.. cpp:function::  mcDINT pos(void)

    Get the actual position (``raw_unit``) of the servo motor.

.. cpp:function::  mcDINT vel(void)

    Get the actual velocity (``raw_unit/sec``) of the servo motor.

    Read SDO parameters.

.. cpp:function::  mcBOOL writeVal(mcUINT index, mcUSINT sub_index, mcUSINT data_length, mcUDINT value)

    Write SDO parameters.

.. cpp:function::  MC_SERVO_ERROR_CODE resetError(mcBOOL& isDone)

    Reset servo motor error.

    - ``isDone``: Set `true` when the reset is completed.
    - ``return``: Return user-defined error code if the servo motor errors cannot be reset.

.. cpp:function::  void runCycle(mcLREAL freq)

    Program tasks in this function that will run in the real-time cycle.

    - ``freq``: The frequency at which this function is called.

.. cpp:function::  void emergStop(void)

    Implement emergency stop commands to the servo motor.

6.4. Run RTmotion with EtherCAT IO
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Running RTmotion with EtherCAT IO needs to replace the virtual IO ``RTmotion::McIO`` with a EtherCAT IO ``RTmotion::EcrtIO``, which can be derived from ``RTmotion::McIO`` as shown here:

.. code-block:: cpp

    class MyIO : public McIO
    {
    public:
        MyIO();
        virtual ~MyIO();

        virtual mcBOOL initializeIO(mcUDINT address) override;
        virtual void runCycle(void) override;

        virtual mcUINT deviceAddr(void);
        virtual MC_IO_ERROR_CODE getErrorCode(void); override;
    };

Refer to the following instructions when writing the IO interface:

.. cpp:function:: mcBOOL initializeIO(mcUDINT address)

    Initialize the IO object with its address:

    - ``address``: Set the unique address of the IO, e.g., slave index for an EtherCAT IO.
    - ``return``: If error occurs, returns `mcFALSE`, otherwise returns `mcTRUE`.

.. cpp:function::  void runCycle()

    Program tasks in this function that will run in the real-time cycle.

.. cpp:function::  mcUINT deviceAddr(void)

    Get the set address of the IO object.

.. cpp:function::  MC_IO_ERROR_CODE getErrorCode(void)

    Get the user-defined error code of the IO object.

After implementing the EtherCAT IO, add the following content to the minimal example presented in the previous section.

- Add code to the global and ``main()`` part:

    .. code-block:: C++

          /* Include plcopen-servo-io and Ethercat EnableKit related headers */
          #include <motionentry.h>
          #include <ecrt_io.hpp>

          static EcrtIO* my_io;
          mcUDINT slave_id   = 0;

          /* Ethercat related global variables */
          static servo_master* master = nullptr;
          static mcUSINT* domain1;
          void* domain;

          /* Varialbe to get ENI file path */
          static char *eni_file = nullptr;

          using namespace RTmotion;

          /* Add following content to the main function */
          int main(int argc, char *argv[])
          {
            ......

            /* Create EtherCAT master through ENI File */
            if (!eni_file) {
               printf("Error: Unspecify ENI/XML file\n");
                exit(0);
            }
            master = motion_servo_master_create(eni_file);
            free(eni_file);
            eni_file = nullptr;
            if (master == nullptr) {
                return -1;
            }

            /* Motion domain create */
            if (motion_servo_domain_entry_register(master, &domain)) {
                motion_servo_master_release(master);
                return -1;
            }

            if (!motion_servo_driver_register(master, domain)) {
                motion_servo_master_release(master);
                return -1;
            }

            motion_servo_set_send_interval(master);

            if (motion_servo_master_activate(master->master)) {
                printf("fail to activate master\n");
                motion_servo_master_release(master);
                return -1;
            }

            domain1 = motion_servo_domain_data(domain);
            if (!domain1) {
                printf("fail to get domain data\n");
                motion_servo_master_release(master);
                return 0;
            }

            /* Create Ecrt IO object */
            my_io = new EcrtIO();
            if (my_io == nullptr)
            {
              printf("fail to create IO class\n");
              return -1;
            }
            my_io->setMaster(master);
            my_io->setDomain(domain1);

            // specify the slave and check initialization results
            if (my_io->initializeIO(slave_id) == mcFALSE)
            {
              printf("IO class initialization failed\n");
              printf("%d\n", my_io->getErrorCode());
              delete my_io;
              motion_servo_master_release(master);
              return -1;
            }
            // check initialization results and print IO info
            my_io->printIOInfo();

            ......

            /* Need to release EtherCAT master after the RT-thread exit */
            motion_servo_master_release(master);
            delete my_io;
          }

- Add code to the cyclic thread part:

    .. code-block:: C++

          /* RX to get EtherCAT data at the beginning of the cycle */
          motion_servo_recv_process(master->master, static_cast<uint8_t *>(domain));
          my_io->runCycle();

          /* Action execution part */
          // fb_read_digital_input test
          mcUSINT input_result = static_cast<mcUSINT>(fb_read_digital_input.getValue());
          if (fb_read_digital_input.isValid() == mcTRUE)
          {
            // get digital input successfully
          }
          else if (fb_read_digital_input.isError() == mcTRUE)
          {
            // error handling
          }
          // fb_write_digital_output test
          fb_write_digital_output.setValue(1);
          if (fb_write_digital_output.isError() == mcTRUE)
          {
            // error handling
          }
          // fb_read_digital_output test
          mcUSINT output_result = static_cast<mcUSINT>(fb_read_digital_output.getValue());
          if (fb_read_digital_output.isValid() == mcTRUE)
          {
            // get digital output successfully
          }
          else if (fb_read_digital_output.isError() == mcTRUE)
          {
           // error handling
          }

          /* TX to send EtherCAT data at the end of the cycle */
          clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &dc_period);
          motion_servo_send_process(master->master, static_cast<uint8_t *>(domain));
